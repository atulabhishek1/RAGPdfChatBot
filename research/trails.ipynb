The company sells \\nlaptops in India. He is currently trying to select a distributor for coming five years. The distributor \\nensures that the products are accessible to the customers in the market. Market share of a company \\ndepends on the coverage by the distributor. \\n \\nThe total profit potential of the entire laptop market in Delhi is Rs. 5 crores in the current year and \\npresent value of next four years‘ cumulative profit potential is Rs. 15 crores. \\n \\nThe first choice for Rajat is to enter into long-term contract with a distributor M/s Jagan with whom \\nDubin has done business in the past, and whose distribution system reaches 55 percent of all potential \\ncustomers. At the last moment, however, a colleague suggests Rajat to consider signing a one-year \\ncontract with other distributors. Distributors M/s Bola and M/s James are willing to be partner with \\nDubin. Although a year ago M/s Bola‘s and M/s James‘s coverage reached only 40 and 25 percent of \\ncustomers respectively, they claim to have invested heavily in distribution resources and now expect to \\nbe able to reach 60 percent and 75 percent of customers respectively. The probability of M/s Bola‘s \\nclaim and M/s James‘s claim to be true is 0.60 and 0.20 respectively. The knowledge about distributors‘ \\ncoverage will evolve over time. The assumption is that the true level of coverage offered by the new \\ndistributors could be discovered, with certainty, through a one-year trail, and this trail will reveal exactly \\none of the two levels of coverage: for example in case of M/s Bola – 40 percent (as it was last year) or \\n60 percent (as claimed). In addition, it is also assumed that whatever the coverage is for both \\ndistributors, it will not change over time. Rajat narrows down on three choices, which are as follows: \\n \\nChoice 1. Give a five year contract to the familiar distributor M/s Jagan \\nChoice 2. Give a one year contract to the new distributor M/s Bola, and base next year‘s  \\n                decision to renew contract with M/s Bola on observed coverage for next four \\n                 years contract with M/s Jagan. \\nChoice 3. Give a one-year contract to the new distributor M/s James, and base next year‘s \\n                decision to renew contract with M/s James on observed coverage for next four \\n                years contract with M/s Jagan. \\n \\n \\n52.

McDonald‘s ran a campaign in which it gave game cards to its customers. These game cards made it \\npossible for customers to win hamburgers, French fries, soft drinks, and other fast-food items, as well as \\ncash prizes. Each card had 10 covered spots that could be uncovered by rubbing them with a coin. \\nBeneath three of these spots were ―No Prize‖ signs. Beneath the other seven spots were names of the \\nprizes, two of which were identical. For, example, one card might have two pictures of a hamburger, one \\npicture of a coke, one of French fries, one of a milk shake, one of a $5, one of $1000, and three ―No \\nPrize‖ signs. For this card the customer could win a hamburger. To win on any card, the customer had to \\nuncover the two matching spots (which showed the potential prize for that card) before uncovering a \\n―No Prize‖; any card with a ―No Prize‖ uncovered was automatically void.

It also meant maximizing \\nevery strength we had in order to boost our profi t margins. In reexamining thee direct model, we realized that \\ninventory management was not just a core strength; it could be an incredible opportunity for us, and one that \\nhad not yet been discovered by any of our competitors. \\n \\n \\n  In Version 1.0 the direct  model, we eliminated the reseller, thereby eliminating the markup and the cost \\nof maintaining a store. In Version we went one step further to reduce inventory inefficiencies. Traditionally, a \\nlong chain of partners was involved 1irgettIn customer. Let‘s s ay you have a factory building a PC we‘ll call \\nmodel #4000. The system is then sent to the distributor, which sends it to the warehouse, which sends it to the \\ndealer, who eventually pushes it on to the consumer by advertising, ―I‘ve got model #4000. Come a nd buy it.‖ \\nIf the consumer says, ―But I want model #8000,‖ the dealer replies, ―S orry, I only have model #4000.‖ \\nMeanwhile, the factory keeps building model #4000s and pushing the inventory into the channel. \\n \\n \\n  The result is a glut of model #4000s that n obody wants. Inevitably, someone ends up with too much \\ninventory, and you see big price corrections. The retailer can‘t sell it at the suggested retail price, so the \\nmanufacturer loses money on price protection (a practice common in our industry of compens ating dealers for \\nreductions in suggested selling price). Companies with long, multi -step distribution systems will often fill their \\ndistribution channels with products in an attempt to clear out older targets. This dangerous and inefficient \\npractice is called ―channel stuffing‖ Worst of all, the customer ends up paying for it by purchasing systems that \\nare already out of date. \\n \\n \\n  Because we were building directly to fill customers‘ orders, we didn‘t have finished goods inventory \\ndevaluing on a daily basis . Because we aligned our suppliers to deliver components as we used them, we were \\nable to minimize raw material inventory. Reductions in component costs could be passed on to our customers \\nquickly, which made them happier and improved our competitive advan tage. It also allowed us to deliver the \\nlatest technology to our customers faster than our competitors. \\n \\n \\n  The direct model turns conventional manufacturing inside out. Conventional manufacturing because \\nyour plant can‘t keep going. But if you don‘t know what you need to build because of dramatic changes in \\ndemand, you run the risk of ending up with terrific amounts of excess and obsolete inventory. That is not the \\ngoal. The concept behind the direct model has nothing to do with stockpiling and everything to do with \\ninformation. The quality of your information inversely amount of assets required, in this case excess inventory. \\nWith less information about customer needs, you need massive amounts of inventory. So, if you have great \\ninformation – that is, you know exactly what people want and how much - you need that much, less inventory. \\nLess inventory, of course, corresponds to less inventory depreciation. In the computer industry, component \\nprices are always falling as suppliers introduce faster chips, bigge r disk drivers and modems with ever -greater  \\nIIFT 2008 Set A  -  28 \\n \\nbandwidth. Let‘s say that Dell has six days of inventory. Compare that to an indirect competitor who has \\ntwenty-five days of inventory with another thirty in their distribution channel. That‘s a difference of for ty-nine \\ndays; and in forty-nine days, the cost of materials will decline about 6 percent. \\n \\n \\n  Then there‘s the threat of getting stuck with obsolete inventory if you‘re caught in a transition to a next -\\ngeneration product, as we were with those memory chip in  1989. as the product approaches the end of its life, \\nthe manufacturer has to worry about whether it has too much in the channel and whether a competitor will \\ndump products, destroying profit margins for everyone. This is a perpetual problem in the compute r industry, \\nbut with the direct model, we have virtually eliminated it. We know when our customers are ready to move on \\ntechnologically, and we can get out of the market before its most precious time. We don‘t have to subsidize our \\nlosses, by charging higher prices for other products. \\n \\n \\n  And ultimately, our customer wins. Optimal inventory management really starts with the design process. \\nYou want to design the product so that the entire product supply chain, as well as the manufacturing process, is \\noriented not just for speed but for what we call velocity. Speed means being fast in the first place. Velocity \\nmeans squeezing time out of every step in the process. \\n \\n \\n  Inventory velocity has become a passion for us. To achieve maximum velocity, you have to desig n your \\nproducts in a way that covers the largest part of the market with the fewer number of parts. For example, you \\ndon‘t need nine different disk drives when you can serve 98 percent of the market with only four. We also \\nlearned to take into account the variability of the lost cost and high cost components. Systems were \\nreconfigured to allow for a greater variety of low -cost parts and a limited variety of expensive parts. The goal \\nwas to decrease the number of components to manage, which increased the velocity, which decreased the risk of \\ninventory depreciation, which increased the overall health of our business system. \\n \\n \\n  We were also able to reduce inventory well below the levels anyone thought possible by constantly \\nchallenging and surprising ourselves with the result. We had our internal skeptics when we first started pushing \\nfor ever-lower levels of inventory. I remember the head of our procurement group telling me that this was like \\n―flying low to the ground 300 knots.‖ He was worried that we wouldn‘t see the trees. \\n \\n \\n  In 1993, we had $2.9 billion in sales and $220 million on in inventory. Four years later, we posted $12.3 \\nbillion in sales and had inventory of 33 million. We‘re now down to six days of inventory and we‘re starting to \\nmeasure it in hours  instead of days. Once you reduce your inventory while maintaining your growth rate, a \\nsignificant amount of risk comes from the transition from one generation of product to the next. Without \\ntraditional stock of inventory, it is critical to precisely time  the discontinuance of the older product line with the \\nramp-up in customer demand for the newer, one. Since we were introducing new products all the time, it \\nbecame imperative to avoid the huge drag effect from mistakes made during transitions. ―excess and  obsolete‖ - \\nbecame taboo at Dell. We would debate about whether our E&O was 30 or 50 cent per PC. Since anything less \\nthan $20 per PC is not bad, when you‘re down in the cents range, you‘re approaching stellar performance. \\n \\n \\n   \\n   \\nIIFT 2008 Set A  -  29 \\n \\nIn effect, we got stronger wi th each transition and more competitive with each turn of the crank. We were \\nincreasing our productivity and improving our cash flow in a broader range of products in larger and larger \\nmarkets. Unlike that period in 1993, when every day the news got a litt le worse, now, finally, every day the \\nnews was better and better. \\n \\n \\n86. Find out the TRUE statement: \\n \\nA.

At Belize there had been great alarm of \\none cruel gang of pirates (always more pirates than enough in those Caribbean Seas), and as they got the better \\nof our English cruisers by running into out -of-the-way creeks and shallows, and taking the land when they were \\nhotly pressed, the governor of Belize had received orders from home to keep a sharp look -out for them along \\nshore. Now, there was an armed sloop came once a year from Port Royal, Jamaica, to the Island, laden  with all \\nmanner of necessaries to eat, and to drink, and to wear, and to use in various ways; and it was aboard of that \\nsloop which had touched at Belize, that I was standing, leaning over the bulwarks. \\n \\n \\n \\n  The Island was occupied by a very small English c olony. It had been given the name of Silver -Store. \\nThe reason of its being so called, was, that the English colony owned and worked a silver -mine over on the \\nmainland, in Honduras, and used this Island as a safe and convenient place to store their silver i n, until it was \\nannually fetched away by the sloop. It was brought down from the mine to the coast on the backs of mules, \\nattended by friendly local people and guarded by white men; from thence it was conveyed over to Silver -Store, \\nwhen the weather was fai r, in the canoes of that country; from Silver -Store, it was carried to Jamaica by the \\narmed sloop once a-year, as I have already mentioned; from Jamaica, it went, of course, all over the world.  \\n \\n \\n \\n  How I came to be aboard the armed sloop, is easily told. F our-and-twenty marines under command of a \\nlieutenant - that officer‘s name was Linderwood - had been told off at Belize, to proceed to Silver -Store, in aid \\nof boats and seamen stationed there for the chase of the Pirates. The Island was considered a good p ost of \\nobservation against the pirates, both by land and sea; neither the pirate ship nor yet her boats had been seen by \\nany of us, but they had been so much heard of, that the reinforcement was sent. Of that party, I was one. It \\nincluded a corporal and a sergeant. Charker was corporal, and the sergeant‘s name was Drooce. He was the \\nmost tyrannical non-commissioned officer in His Majesty‘s service. \\n \\n \\n \\n  The night came on, soon after I had had the foregoing words with Charker. All the wonderful bright \\ncolours went out of the sea and sky in a few minutes, and all the stars in the Heavens seemed to shine out \\ntogether, and to look down at themselves in the sea, over one another‘s shoulders, millions deep.  \\nIIFT 2008 Set A  -  31 \\n \\n \\n \\n  Next morning, we cast anchor off the Island. There was a  snug harbour within a little reef; there was a \\nsandy beach; there were cocoa -nut trees with high straight stems, quite bare, and foliage at the top like plumes \\nof magnificent green feathers; there were all the objects that are usually seen in those parts,  and I am not going \\nto describe them, having something else to tell about. \\n \\n \\n \\n  Great rejoicings, to be sure, were made on our arrival. All the flags in the place were hoisted, all the \\nguns in the place were fired, and all the people in the place came down t o look at us. One of the local people \\nhad come off outside the reef, to pilot us in, and remained on board after we had let go our anchor. \\n \\n \\n \\n  My officer, Lieutenant Linderwood, was as ill as the captain of the sloop, and was carried ashore, too. \\nThey were both young men of about my age, who had been delicate in the West India climate. I thought I was \\nmuch fitter for the work than they were, and that if all of us had our deserts, I should be both of them rolled into \\none. (It may be imagined what sort of an o fficer of marines I should have made, without the power of reading a \\nwritten order. And as to any knowledge how to command the sloop —Lord! I should have sunk her in a quarter \\nof an hour!) \\n \\n \\n \\n  However, such were my reflections; and when we men were ashore an d dismissed, I strolled about the \\nplace along with Charker, making my observations in a similar spirit. \\n \\n \\n \\n  It was a pretty place: in all its arrangements partly South American and partly English, and very \\nagreeable to look at on that account, being like a bit of home that had got chipped off and had floated away to \\nthat spot, accommodating itself to circumstances as it drifted along. The huts of the local people, to the number \\nof five- and-twenty, perhaps, were down by the beach to the left of the anchorage . On the right was a sort of \\nbarrack, with a South American Flag and the Union Jack, flying from the same staff, where the little English \\ncolony could all come together, if they saw occasion. It was a walled square of building, with a sort of pleasure -\\nground inside, and inside that again a sunken block like a powder magazine, with a little square trench round it, \\nand steps down to the door. \\n \\n \\n \\n  Charker and I were looking in at the gate, which was not guarded; and I had said to Charker, in reference \\nto the bi t like a powder magazine, ―That‘s where they keep the silver you see;‖ and Charker had said to me, \\nafter thinking it over, ―And silver ain‘t gold. Is it, Gill?‖ \\n \\n   \\nIIFT 2008 Set A  -  32 \\n \\n90. Find out the TRUE statement: \\n \\nA.

When Corporal Charker and Sergent Gill were walking around the harbour, they noticed that the size \\nof the settlement of the local people was not very large. \\n  \\nIIFT 2008 Set A  -  33 \\n \\nPassage – 3 \\n \\n  We now come to the second part of our journey under the sea. T he first ended with the moving scene in \\nthe coral cemetery which left a deep impression on my mind. I could no longer content myself with the theory \\nwhich satisfied Conseil. That worthy fellow persisted in seeing in the Commander of the Nautilus one of tho se \\nunknown servants who returns mankind contempt for indifference. For him, he was a misunderstood genius \\nwho, tired of earth‘s deceptions, had taken refuge in this inaccessible medium, where he might follow his \\ninstincts freely. To my mind, this explains but one side of Captain Nemo‘s character. Indeed, the mystery of that \\nlast night during which we had been chained in prison, the sleep, and the precaution so violently taken by the \\nCaptain of snatching from my eyes the glass I had raised to sweep the horiz on, the mortal wound of the man, \\ndue to an unaccountable shock of the Nautilus, all put me on a new track. No; Captain Nemo was not satisfied \\nwith shunning man. His formidable apparatus not only suited his instinct of freedom, but perhaps also the \\ndesign of some terrible retaliation.  \\n \\n \\n  That day, at noon, the second officer came to take the altitude of the sun. I mounted the platform, and \\nwatched the operation. As he was taking observations with the sextant, one of the sailors of the Nautilus (the \\nstrong man who had accompanied us on our first submarine excursion to the Island of Crespo) came to clean the \\nglasses of the lantern. I examined the fittings of the apparatus, the strength of which was increased a \\nhundredfold by lenticular rings, placed similar to  those in a lighthouse, and which projected their brilliance in a \\nhorizontal plane. The electric lamp was combined in such a way as to give its most powerful light. Indeed, it \\nwas produced in vacuo, which insured both its steadiness and its intensity. This  vacuum economised the \\ngraphite points between which the luminous arc was developed - an important point of economy for Captain \\nNemo, who could not easily have replaced them; and under these conditions their waste was imperceptible. \\nWhen the Nautilus was r eady to continue its submarine journey, I went down to the saloon. The panel was \\nclosed, and the course marked direct west.  \\n \\n \\n  We were furrowing the waters of the Indian Ocean, a vast liquid plain, with a surface of 1,200,000,000 \\nof acres, and whose water s are so clear and transparent that any one leaning over them would turn giddy. The \\nNautilus usually floated between fifty and a hundred fathoms deep. We went on so for some days. To anyone \\nbut myself, who had a great love for the sea, the hours would have  seemed long and monotonous; but the daily \\nwalks on the platform, when I steeped myself in the reviving air of the ocean, the sight of the rich waters \\nthrough the windows of the saloon, the books in the library, the compiling of my memoirs, took up all my time, \\nand left me not a moment of ennui or weariness. \\n \\n \\n  From the 21 st to the 23 rd of January the Nautilus went at the rate of two hundred and fifty leagues in \\ntwenty-four hours, being five hundred and forty miles, or twenty -two miles an hour. If we recogn ized so many \\ndifferent varieties of fish, it was because, attracted by the electric light, they tried to follow us; the greater part, \\nhowever, were soon distanced by our speed, though some kept their place in the waters of the Nautilus for a \\ntime. The morning of the 24 th, we observed Keeling Island, a coral formation, planted with magnificent cocos, \\nand which had been visited by Mr. Darwin and Captain Fitzroy. The Nautilus skirted the shores of this desert \\nisland for a little distance. Soon Keeling Island disappeared from the horizon, and our course was directed to the \\nnorth-west in the direction of the Indian Peninsula. \\n \\n \\n  From Keeling Island our course was slower and more variable, often taking us into great depths. Several  \\nIIFT 2008 Set A  -  34 \\n \\ntimes they made use of the incli ned planes, which certain internal levers placed obliquely to the waterline. I \\nobserved that in the upper regions the water was always colder in the high levels than at the surface of the sea. \\nOn the 25th of January the ocean was entirely deserted; the Nau tilus passed the day on the surface, beating the \\nwaves with its powerful screw and making them rebound to a great height. Three parts of this day I spent on the \\nplatform. I watched the sea. Nothing on the horizon, till about four o‘clock a steamer running west on our \\ncounter. Her masts were visible for an instant, but she could not see the Nautilus, being too low in the water. I \\nfancied this steamboat belonged to the P.O. Company, which runs from Ceylon to Sydney, touching at King \\nGeorge‘s Point and Melbourne. \\n \\n \\n  At five o‘clock in the evening, before that fleeting twilight which binds night to day in tropical zones, \\nConseil and I were astonished by a curious spectacle. It was a shoal of argonauts traveling along on the surface \\nof the ocean. We could count s everal hundreds. These graceful molluscs moved backwards by means of their \\nlocomotive tube, through which they propelled the water already drawn in. Of their eight tentacles, six were \\nelongated, and stretched out floating on the water, whilst the other two , rolled up flat, were spread to the wing \\nlike a light sail. I saw their spiral -shaped and fluted shells, which Cuvierjustly compares to an elegant skiff. For \\nnearly an hour the Nautilus floated in the midst of this shoal of molluscs. \\n \\n \\n  The next day, 26th of January, we cut the equator at the eighty -second meridian and entered the northern \\nhemisphere. During the day a formidable troop of sharks accompanied us. They were ―cestracio philippi‖ \\nsharks, with brown backs and whitish bellies, armed with eleven ro ws of teeth, their throat being marked with a \\nlarge black spot surrounded with white like an eye. There were also some Isabella sharks, with rounded snouts \\nmarked with dark spots. These powerful creatures often hurled themselves at the windows of the saloo n with \\nsuch violence as to make us feel very insecure. But the Nautilus, accelerating her speed, easily left the most \\nrapid of them behind. \\n \\n \\n  About seven o‘clock in the evening, the Nautilus, half -immersed, was sailing in a sea of milk. At first \\nsight the ocean seemed lactified. Was it the effect of the lunar rays? No; for the moon, scarcely two days old, \\nwas still lying hidden under the horizon in the rays of the sun. The whole sky, though lit by the sidereal rays, \\nseemed black by contrast with the whiten ess of the waters. Conseil could not believe his eyes, and questioned \\nme as to the cause of this strange phenomenon. Happily I was able to answer him. \\n \\n \\n  ―It is called a milk sea,‖ I explained. ―A large extent of white wavele often to be seen on the coasts  of \\nAmboyna, and in these parts of the sea.‖ \\n \\n \\n  ―But, sir,‖ said Conseil, ―can you tell me what causes such an effect? For I suppose the water i s not \\nreally turned into milk.‖ \\n \\n \\n  ―No, my boy; and the whiteness which surprises you is caused only by the pr esence of myriads of \\nluminous little worm, gelatinous and without colour, of the thickness of a hair, and whose length is not more \\nthan seven -thousandths of an inch. These insects adhere to one another sometimes for several leagues.‖  \\n \\n  ―Several leagues!‖ exclaimed Conseil.  \\nIIFT 2008 Set A  -  35 \\n \\n \\n \\n  ―Yes, my boy; and you need not try to compute the number of these infusoria. You will not be able, for, \\nif I am not mistaken, ships have floated on these milk seas for more than forty miles.‖ \\n \\n \\n  Towards midnight the sea suddenly resum ed its usual colour; but behind us, even to the limits of the \\nhorizon, the sky reflected the whitened waves, and for a long time seemed impregnated with the vague \\nglimmerings of an aurora borealis. \\n \\n94.
